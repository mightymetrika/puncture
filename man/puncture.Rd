\usage{
puncture(
  dat,
  b = 5,
  m = 5,
  stacks = 1,
  thin = 1,
  mpat = function(mdat) {
     n <- nrow(mdat) * ncol(mdat)
     c1 <- stats::rbinom(n,
    1, 0.7)
     c2 <- stats::rbinom(n, 1, 0.6)

\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame or matrix containing the complete dataset before introducing
missing values. Must have at least 2 rows and 1 column.}

\item{b}{A positive integer specifying the number of bootstrap iterations to perform.
Default is 5.}

\item{m}{A positive integer specifying the number of multiple imputations to generate
for each bootstrap sample. Default is 5.}

\item{stacks}{A positive integer specifying the number of copies of the dataset to create
and stack in each bootstrap iteration. Each copy will have a different missingness
pattern. Default is 1.}

\item{thin}{A numeric vector of proportions between 0 and 1, with length equal to stacks
(or length 1 for recycling). Specifies the proportion of rows to retain in each
stacked dataset. For example, thin = c(1, 0.5) with stacks = 2 will keep all rows
in the first dataset and randomly select 50\% of rows in the second dataset. Default is 1.}

\item{mpat}{A function that takes a dataset as input and returns a matrix of the same
dimensions with 1's indicating observed values and 0's indicating missing values.
The default function implements a simple random missingness pattern based on
independent Bernoulli trials.}

\item{form}{A character string specifying the model formula (e.g., "y ~ x").}

\item{func}{A function to fit the model, such as \code{stats::lm} or \code{stats::glm}.
Default is \code{stats::lm}.}

\item{term}{A character string specifying the predictor term of interest in the model
for which statistics should be extracted.}

\item{statistics}{A character vector specifying which statistics to extract for the
term of interest. The \code{broom::tidy()} names are used for statistics. Default
is c("estimate", "std.error", "statistic", "p.value").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{mice::mice()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with \code{b} rows and columns corresponding to the requested
statistics. Each row represents results from one bootstrap iteration after
multiple imputation and pooling.
}
\description{
Implements a bootstrap-based analysis method that combines multiple imputation
for missing data and data augmentation techniques to address small sample size
issues. For each bootstrap iteration, the function creates multiple copies of the dataset
with different missingness patterns ("punctures" the data), applies multiple
imputation to the punctured dataset, fits a specified model, and pools results
across imputations. The method also includes the option to make multiple punctured
datasets within each bootstrap iteration and then thin the data and stack the
punctured & thinned datasets.
}
\details{
The function implements the following base algorithm for each bootstrap iteration:
\enumerate{
\item Generate a missingness pattern using the specified \code{mpat} function
\item Apply the pattern to create a dataset with missing values
\item Perform multiple imputation using \code{mice}
\item Fit the specified model to each imputed dataset
\item Pool results across imputations using Rubin's rules
\item Extract the requested statistics for the term of interest
}

When the optional stacking parameter (\code{stacks} > 1) is used, the algorithm is
modified to create and combine multiple copies of the dataset before imputation:
\enumerate{
\item For each of the specified number of stacks:
\itemize{
\item Generate and apply a unique missingness pattern
\item Optionally thin the data by randomly selecting rows (if \code{thin} < 1)
}
\item Combine all resulting datasets
\item Proceed with multiple imputation and subsequent steps as in the base algorithm
}

The stacking and thinning extensions are designed to address small sample size
issues by creating multiple versions of the dataset with different missingness
patterns. This approach leverages missing data machinery to estimate parameters
when the original sample size is limited.

\note{
The default missingness pattern function creates missing values through two
independent Bernoulli trials with success probabilities 0.7 and 0.6. A value
is observed (1 in the pattern matrix) only if both trials are successful.
