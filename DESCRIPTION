Description: The bootstrap method and methods for handling missing data are used
    often in data analysis to obtain valid inferences when the data violate
    assumptions of a statistical model. The 'puncture' package implements an
    algorithm where a missing data pattern is used to create samples of the
    original dataset with added missing data (these samples are the punctured data).
    Each punctured dataset is then processed using a missing data method (like
    multiple imputation); finally, the results across punctured datasets are
    combined using methods to combine bootstrap resamples. The puncture() function
    provides a framework to implement a multiple imputation based version of the
    algorithm. The puncture_lm_sim() function can be used to run linear regression
    simulations comparing the simple bootstrap to the method implemented in
    puncture().
